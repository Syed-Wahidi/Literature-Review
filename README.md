# Literature-Review
CSC 481
We are working on getting a client and are talking with a instructor, Mr. Cox, on getting a client. We can't do a real literature review
since we don't know the clients specifications. Mr. Cox said we will be getting a email soon on the specification of our project. We are 
hopeful that the client is going to provide a project for our team to work on as soon as possible. As for now we are waiting on the email
by Mr. Cox for the exact things the client need.
